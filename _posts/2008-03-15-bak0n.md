Have you ever wondered why we have fake bacon bits and yet no fake
bacon? I too have wondered, pondered this great mistery, then about 5
minutes ago the answer hit me; fake bacon bits taste like crap, thus
fake bacon would taste like more crap. In doses higher than .1 cc, fake
bacon would be unfathomably crapilicious. With this revelation, I now
feel like a truly enlightened being.
