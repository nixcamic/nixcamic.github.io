After much dwelling on what to call a band if I were to have one, I have decided upon "TopheavyÂ Dishwasher". It has a nice fullness to it don't you think? If I don't have a band, but instead a company that makes stuff or something, I think the same would also work. InÂ leuÂ of any of that, it would make anÂ excellentÂ name for one of my children.
