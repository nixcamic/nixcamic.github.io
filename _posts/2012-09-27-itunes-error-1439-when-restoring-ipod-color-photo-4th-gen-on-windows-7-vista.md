title: iTunes error 1439 when restoring iPod Color/Photo/4th gen on Windows 7/Vista
tags: []

I kept getting error 1439 when trying to restore an iPod Color in
Windows. It would restore fine in OS X and was giveing the same error
across multiple windows computers.

Googling turned up nothing but the solution is dirt simple: **Right
click on iTunes and run as an administrator.**

Also, if you have MacDrive installed you probably need to disable it or
you’ll get a “The iPod can not be restored because it contains files
that are in use by another application.” error.
