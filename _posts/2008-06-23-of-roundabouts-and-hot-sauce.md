If you have ever laid in the centre of a traffic circle surrounded in
small bushes and looked straight up into the air, you would know the
following to be true; cars driving around you look surprisingly like
dogs running at you, its rather unnerving. In other news the restaurant
I went to in mexico had tabasco sauce imported from the USA, which
strikes me as rather ironic.
