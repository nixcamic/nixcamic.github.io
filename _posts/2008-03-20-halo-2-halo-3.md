Mainly in the areas of map design, but I really thing the series as a
whole peaked around 2. It’s just more fun, although that is largely
because of the maps, there are other things too. Maybe I just need more
time to get into my halo 3 groove, but I don’t remember ever thinking
this about 2. Its too clean, too polished, to perfect. All good games
are flawed, like any art form. I think after the newness of 3 wears off,
we will all see the light and convert back to halo 2. Perhaps on pc :)
